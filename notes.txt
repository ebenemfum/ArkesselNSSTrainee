Phase 1: PHP Fundamentals

Task 1: PHP Syntax and Variables


1. Syntax: Understand the language's syntax, which includes its rules for writing code, such as using proper punctuation, indentation, and keywords.
2. Variables and Data Types: Learn how to declare variables, assign values to them, and understand different data types like integers, floats, strings, and boolean.
3. . Operators: Master arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators, which allow you to perform calculations, make comparisons, and manipulate data.
4. Based on what you have learnt so far, create a simple PHP script that calculates yearly profits.



a. Create a PHP script that calculates the yearly profits based on the following inputs:
• Monthly Gross Salary
• Monthly Net Salary
• Monthly Household Expenditure


b. Assumptions:
• There are 12 months in a year.
• Gross salary remains constant throughout the year.
• Net salary and household expenditure are considered per month.
Task 2: Control Structure and Loops
1. Control Structures: Study control flow mechanisms like conditionals (if statements, switch statements) and loops (for loops, while loops), which help you manage the flow of your program.
2. Build a program that iterates through an array and displays its content.
Task 3: Functions
1. Functions: Understand how to define and call functions. Functions allow you to encapsulate code for reuse and modularity.
2. Build a program that employs the use of functions and control structure and display the output.
