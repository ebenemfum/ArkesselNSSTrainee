Task 2: Control Structure and Loops
1. Control Structures: Study control flow mechanisms like conditionals (if statements, switch statements) and loops (for loops, while loops), which help you manage the flow of your program.
2. Build a program that iterates through an array and displays its content.

    <?php

//Array
$numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8];
echo "Numbers in the Array are : " ;
foreach($numbers as $number){
    echo "$number ";
};

    ?>
